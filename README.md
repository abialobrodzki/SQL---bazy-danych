# SQL database
Effects of my work in MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE & MySQL Server
Relase: Workbench 8.0.27 x64 // Server 8.0.27 x64

My mySQL practise with database:
- exercises in Coders Lab prework
- in Sakila Sample Database https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/
- in Northwind database https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs
- in SCHOOL local Coders Lab database

Include: 
SELECT (); WHERE (); ORDER BY (); DISTINCT (); AS (); COUNT (); MAX() MIN() SUM() AVG(); GROUP BY(), INNER JOIN (); LEFT JOIN(); RIGHT JOIN ();

CREATE DATABASE (); CREATE TABLE ();
INSERT INTO ();
UPDATE (); DELETE ();
ALTER TABLE ();
DROPT TABLE ();
